        <s>The Ada School platform allows you to create student teams within a cohort. Students decide how to form the teams for group work.</s>
        <s>After creating a team, each member receives a different task that is part of the group task.</s>
        <s> Each student must solve her homework with the help of her team members. Once they solve the task, the platform uses unit tests to evaluate the result.</s>
        <s>When these unit tests pass, the result is uploaded to the platform so that other team members can use it as part of the group task.</s>
        <s>when all team members have uploaded their solutions, they are graded and can progress with other course assignments </s>
